IMAGE DENOISING (LOW LIGHT IMAGE ENHANCEMENT)
This project tackles the challenge of enhancing low-light images. It leverages a deep learning technique called Zero-Reference Deep Curve Estimation (Zero-DCE). 
This project focuses on implementing the Zero-DCE model and evaluating its effectiveness in enhancing low-light images.
Final evaluation will be done based on your PSNR score on the test dataset.
